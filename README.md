# CSSJSVars

Behold the almighty CSS variables, updated using the power of JavaScript!

Use the sliders to adjust the padding around the image, or to increase/decrease the blur filter on the image. Click the colored rectangle under the sliders to change the color of the padding and of the letters "JS". 
These elements are dynamically updated using CSS Variables and JavaScript. 

This was built as a learning effort while completing Wes Bos' JS30 Challenge.
